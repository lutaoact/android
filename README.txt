This repo contains working code for the example in O'Reilly's _Programming Android, 2nd Edition_;  Mednieks, Dornin, Meike, Nakamura (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023005.do)

The projects have all been tested in eclipse, using the emulator (with the exception of a couple that are hardware dependent; those projects have notes to that effect in their README files)

If you have a question, you might check the FAQ:

https://github.com/bmeike/ProgrammingAndroidExamples/wiki/FAQ

To set up a project, check it out and then:
cd $PROJ
cp tools/ide/eclipse/project .project
cp tools/ide/eclipse/classpath .classpath

Start eclipse and use File > Import > "Existing project into workspace"

Comments are welcome! Send problems and comments to programmingandroidexamples at callmeike dot net.
